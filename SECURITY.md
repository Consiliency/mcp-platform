## Security Best Practices

When using MCP Platform, we recommend:

### Authentication & Authorization
- Always use strong authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth 2.0)
- Implement proper role-based access control
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- Use multi-factor authentication for administrative access

### Network Security
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher for all communications
- Implement proper certificate validation
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Enable CORS only for trusted domains

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### Monitoring & Logging
- Enable comprehensive logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regularly review access logs

### Updates & Patches
- Keep MCP Platform updated to the latest version
- Subscribe to security advisories
- Test updates in a staging environment first
- Have a rollback plan
