   - Publish Go SDK as Go module

3. **Enterprise Features Re-evaluation**
   - Assess actual need for multi-tenancy
   - Determine SSO requirements
   - Plan RBAC implementation

4. **Production Hardening**

## 🔧 Using Current Features

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Consiliency/mcp-platform.git
cd mcp-platform/mcp-local-setup

# Install and start
./install.sh
mcp start

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:8080/catalog.html
```

### SDK Usage (Local)
```javascript
// JavaScript
const MCPClient = require('./path/to/mcp-platform/sdk/js');

// Python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/mcp-platform/sdk/python')
from mcp_sdk import MCPClient

// Go
// Use go.mod replace directive
```

## 📝 Notes

1. **Documentation vs Reality**: Some documentation describes aspirational features. This document reflects actual implementation status.

2. **Roadmap Accuracy**: The roadmap marks many features as "complete" but implementation may differ from original specifications.

3. **Local vs Published**: Many components work locally but aren't published/deployed for public use.

4. **Focus Areas**: Current development focuses on core MCP functionality rather than enterprise features.
