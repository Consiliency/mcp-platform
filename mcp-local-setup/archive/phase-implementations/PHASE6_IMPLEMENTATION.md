# Phase 6 Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation boundaries and responsibilities for Phase 6 parallel development teams.

## Team Assignments

### 1. Security API Team

**Scope**: Implement comprehensive API security features

**Boundaries**:
- `/security/api-auth/` - Authentication mechanisms
- `/security/middleware/` - Security middleware
- `/security/validation/` - Input validation
- `/config/production/api.config.js` - API configuration

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] JWT authentication system
- [ ] OAuth2 integration
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] CORS configuration
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization

**Interfaces**: Must implement `SecurityAPIInterface` from `/interfaces/phase6/security-api.interface.js`

### 2. Docker Production Team

**Scope**: Create production-ready containerization

**Boundaries**:
- `/docker/production/` - Production Dockerfiles and configs
- `/docker/health/` - Health monitoring implementations
- `docker-compose.production.yml` - Production orchestration

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfiles for all services
- [ ] Production docker-compose configuration
- [ ] Health check implementations
- [ ] Graceful shutdown handling
- [ ] Resource optimization
- [ ] Security scanning integration

**Interfaces**: Must implement `HealthMonitorInterface` from `/interfaces/phase6/health-monitor.interface.js`

### 3. CI/CD Team

**Scope**: Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines

**Boundaries**:
- `/.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `/scripts/build/` - Build and deployment scripts
- `/config/production/deployment.config.js` - Deployment configuration

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] CI pipeline with testing and quality checks
- [ ] CD pipeline with multi-environment support
- [ ] Release automation
- [ ] Build scripts for all components
- [ ] Test automation integration
- [ ] Deployment rollback mechanisms

**Interfaces**: Work with existing `CICDIntegration` from `/integrations/ci/`

### 4. Observability Team

**Scope**: Implement logging, metrics, and monitoring

**Boundaries**:
- `/monitoring/` - Monitoring implementations
- `/config/production/monitoring.config.js` - Monitoring configuration
- Existing implementations in `/monitoring/logging/`, `/monitoring/metrics/`, `/monitoring/errors/`

**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Structured logging system
- [ ] Metrics collection and export
- [ ] Error tracking and reporting
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Alert configuration
- [ ] Dashboard creation

**Interfaces**: Must implement:
- `LoggerInterface` from `/interfaces/phase6/logger.interface.js`
- `MetricsInterface` from `/interfaces/phase6/metrics.interface.js`
- `ErrorTrackerInterface` from `/interfaces/phase6/error-tracker.interface.js`

- Deployment orchestration

### Docker ↔ Observability
- Container health metrics
- Log aggregation from containers
- Performance monitoring

### CI/CD ↔ Observability
- Build and deployment metrics
- Pipeline monitoring
- Deployment tracking

## Development Guidelines

1. **Communication**: Use the TODO markers in stub files to track progress
2. **Testing**: Each team must provide comprehensive tests for their components
3. **Documentation**: Update this document with implementation details as you progress
4. **Integration**: Coordinate with other teams on shared interfaces
5. **Security**: Follow security best practices in all implementations

## Timeline

- Week 1-2: Core implementation
- Week 3: Integration testing
- Week 4: Production readiness and documentation

## Success Criteria

- All TODO markers replaced with working implementations
- All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Security audit passed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation complete
- Successfully deployed to production environment
