## Breaking Changes

None - Phase 6 maintains backward compatibility with existing APIs.

## Migration Guide

No migration required. Phase 6 features are additive and optional.

## Known Issues

- Some integration tests may fail in CI/CD environment due to service dependencies
- Documentation tests require network access for external link validation

## Contributors

This release was made possible through the parallel development approach using git worktrees, allowing 6 teams to work simultaneously without merge conflicts.

## What's Next

With Phase 6 complete, the MCP Platform is now production-ready with:
- Enterprise-grade security
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Automated deployment
- Extensive documentation

The platform is ready for production deployments at scale.
