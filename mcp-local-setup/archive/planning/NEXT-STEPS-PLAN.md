# MCP Platform - Next Steps Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to complete the MCP Platform product, transforming it from a functional prototype into a production-ready platform. The plan is organized into four phases, each building upon the previous to ensure continuous usability while adding advanced features.

## Current State

✅ **Completed**:

  ```

- **Interactive Service Installation** (`cli/mcp-cli.js:391`)
  ```javascript
  // Interactive prompts for service selection
  // Environment variable collection
  // Profile selection and update
  ```

#### 1.2 Create Missing Docker Templates

  ```

- **Data Persistence**
  - Volume backup strategies
  - Service data export/import
  - Migration tools

#### 3.3 Update Mechanism
- **Platform Updates**
  ```bash
  mcp self-update          # Update MCP platform
  mcp service update <id>  # Update specific service
  mcp update --all        # Update everything
  ```

- **Version Management**
  - Rollback capability
  - Changelog generation

  ```bash
  mcp search <query>       # Search marketplace
  mcp featured            # Show featured services
  mcp trending            # Show trending services
  ```

- **Publishing**
  ```bash
  mcp publish             # Publish service to marketplace
