# IDE Extensions Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented the IDE Extensions for Phase 5 of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem. The implementation provides rich development experience across VS Code, IntelliJ, and Vim/Neovim editors.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core IDE Extension (`ide/core/`)

- **ide-extension.js**: Main implementation of the IDEExtensionInterface
  - Language Server Protocol support
  - Code completion for MCP services and methods
  - Hover information with service documentation
  - Diagnostics for configuration validation
  - Code actions (quick fixes)
  - Service management UI preparation
  - Debugging support

- **language-server.js**: Language Server Protocol implementation
  - Handles completion, hover, diagnostics, and code actions
  - Compatible with any LSP-enabled editor
  - Supports MCP-specific features

- **mock-sdk.js**: Mock SDK implementation for testing
  - Implements all SDK methods required by the IDE extension
  - Provides sample services (postgres-mcp, mysql-mcp, redis-mcp, etc.)
  - Simulates service health and debugging endpoints

### 2. VS Code Extension (`ide/vscode/`)

- **Full-featured extension** with:
  - Language client integration
  - Service explorer in activity bar
  - Health monitoring panel
  - Commands for service management
  - Code snippets for common patterns
  - Configuration settings
  - Debugging support
  - Webview panels for service details

- **package.json**: Complete extension manifest with:
  - Command contributions
  - View containers and views
  - Language support for MCP config files
  - Debugger configuration
  - Activation events

### 3. IntelliJ Plugin (`ide/intellij/`)

- **Plugin structure** with:
  - Completion contributor for MCP services
  - Configuration file annotator
  - Documentation provider
  - Tool window factory
  - Actions for service management

- **plugin.xml**: Plugin descriptor with:
  - Extension points
  - Actions and menus
  - File type associations
  - Inspections and intentions

### 4. Vim/Neovim Plugin (`ide/vim/`)

- **Complete Vim plugin** with:
  - Commands for service management
  - Omni-completion support
  - Diagnostics with signs
  - Service browser
  - nvim-cmp integration for Neovim
  - Key mappings for quick access

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Code Completion**
   - Context-aware suggestions for MCP methods
   - Service name completion in string literals
   - Method signatures with snippets

2. **Hover Information**
   - Service descriptions and versions
   - Configuration options documentation
   - Real-time service status

3. **Diagnostics**
   - Configuration file validation
   - Unknown service detection
   - Invalid option warnings
   - JSON syntax error detection

4. **Code Actions**
   - Quick fix to install missing services
   - Remove invalid configuration options
   - Context-sensitive actions

5. **Service Management**
   - Visual service explorer
   - Health monitoring
   - Service installation/uninstallation
   - Configuration management

6. **Debugging Support**
   - Start debug sessions for services
   - Integration with service debug endpoints
   - Breakpoint management

## Testing

All integration tests pass successfully:

```
✓ IDE extension initializes with SDK instance
✓ Code completion suggests available MCP services
✓ Hover info shows service documentation from SDK
✓ Diagnostics validate service configurations against SDK
✓ Service panel shows real-time health from SDK
✓ Debugging integration uses SDK service endpoints
✓ Code actions can install missing services via SDK
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Shared Core**: All IDE extensions use the same core implementation
2. **Language Server**: Provides consistent features across all editors
3. **SDK Integration**: Properly uses SDK for all MCP operations
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features to all IDEs at once
5. **Testability**: Standalone implementations allow thorough testing

## Usage Examples

### VS Code
```javascript
// Auto-completion and hover info
mcp.connectService('postgres-mcp', {
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'myapp'
});
```

### IntelliJ
```java
// Service management with quick fixes
SDK.installService("redis-mcp", config);
```

### Vim
```vim
:MCPShowServices
:MCPInstallService mysql-mcp
<leader>mh  " Check service health
```

## Next Steps

The IDE extensions are now ready for:
1. Publishing to respective marketplaces (VS Code, JetBrains, Vim)
2. Integration with the real SDK implementation
3. User testing and feedback
4. Additional language support (Python, Go, etc.)
5. Enhanced debugging features
